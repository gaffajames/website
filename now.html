<h1> What I&rsquo;m doing now</h1>

<p>This is a <a href="http://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>. If you have your own site, you should make one, too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m celebrating eight years at the Department for Transport in the UK. I&rsquo;m currently working to make the rail industry a world leader in the use of technology, telecoms and data.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m helping my mate, <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesofwords">James Wordsworth</a>, sell his books.</p>

<p>I volunteer with the <a href="http://www.theaccessproject.org.uk/">Access Project</a> as a GCSE tutor. If you live in London, why don&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>As always, I am busy learning. For now, I&rsquo;m learning coding (starting with this website) and relearning the guitar. I&rsquo;m also on the <a href="https://www.coach.me">Coach.me VIP Programme</a>, which involves daily exercises&mdash;currently aimed at setting priorities.</p>

<p>My fitness regime is predominantly made up of gymnastic strength training as I try to fix years of neglecting my mobility.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not doing all that I&rsquo;m relaxing at home with my wife and two cats.</p>
