<h1> What I&rsquo;m doing now</h1>

<p>This is a <a href="http://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">now page</a>. If you have your own site, you should make one, too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just conducted my (first) annual review. I read every journal entry I wrote this year and my <a href="http://www.gavinjames.co.uk/codex">Codex Vitae</a>. I ended up committing to a lot of <a href="http://www.gavinjames.co.uk/resolutions/2017">resolutions</a>.

<p>I&rsquo;m celebrating eight years at the Department for Transport in the UK. I&rsquo;m currently working to make the rail industry a world leader in the use of technology, telecoms and data.</p>

<p>As always, I am busy learning. For now, I&rsquo;m learning German using the <a href="https://fluent-forever.com/" target="_blank">Fluent Forever</a> method and relearning the guitar (and trying to find a decent classical guitar teacher near Orpington, UK).</p>

<p>My fitness regime is predominantly made up of gymnastic strength training as I try to fix years of neglecting my mobility.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not doing all that I&rsquo;m relaxing at home with my wife and two cats.</p>
