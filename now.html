<h1> What I&rsquo;m doing now</h1>
</div>
<p>This is a <a href="http://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">now page</a>. If you have your own site, you should make one, too.</p>

<p>I've just started a Masters in Occupational and Organisational Psychology at the University of East London. I had been considering some postgrad study in computer science given my move into a digital team. I realised though that I would never be the best computer scientist in the room, but I could be the best psychologist. I&rsquo;m loving it! On one of my modules I am developing my skills in coaching. If you are interested in some free coaching (in exchange for me filming one of our sessions for my assessment), get in touch. One of the great things about UEL is the diversity of students. We are learning about workplaces in different cultures and we have people from every continent in the classroom to explain what they are like. The plan is to continue to develop my skills and experience to become a Chartered Occupational Psychologist in a few years.</p>

<p>I've started getting serious about playing guitar too, so I've set myself the goal of doing a public performance by the end of the year. I&rsquo;m very comfortable speaking in front of a large audience, but playing guitar in front of even just a few people brings me out in a cold sweat. It all goes back to an incident with a bear costume and two out-of-tune guitars. Don&rsquo;t ask!</p>

<p>On the fitness front, I&rsquo;ve started on the <a href="http://amzn.to/2FyeO5F" target="_blank">Starting Strength</a> protocol. My aim is to deadlift double my bodyweight by the end of the year. So far it&rsquo;s been a really effective programme, although mobility–as always–is my weakness. I am also dipping in and out of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at <a href="http://graciebarraoval.com/" target="_blank">Gracie Barre Oval</a>. It&rsquo;s a tough sport!</p>

<p>Work is going well, with my team expanding to cover all the user research for the Department. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://dftdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/03/08/end-user-compute-discovery/">blog about the research we did into what our staff need from their technology</a> and <a href="https://dftdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/01/18/hr-chatbot-dft-lab/" target="_blank">here&rsquo;s one about a chatbot</a> we made in the DfT Lab.</p>

<p>If all that weren&rsquo;t enough, we are extending the house at the moment. It is all very exciting, but exhausting.
