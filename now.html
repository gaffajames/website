<h1> What I&rsquo;m doing now</h1>
</div>
<p>This is a <a href="http://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">now page</a>. If you have your own site, you should make one, too.</p>

<p>Most of my Masters (in Occupational and Organisational Psychology at the University of East London) is done now. I just have my dissertation to do. I&rsquo;m looking into what motivates <a target="_blank" href="http://puttylike.com/terminology/">multipotentialites</a> at work. The rest of the Masters has gone well. I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed the practical elements, such as coaching and facilitation skills. The academic literature around positive psychology is fascinating too. I&rsquo;d really like to use my coaching skills regularly; I&rsquo;m thinking about joining the cross-Government coaching community that offers free coaching to civil servants. One thing I have realised is I don&rsquo;t have the energy or the inclination to go through chartership to be an Occupational Psychologist. The Masters is enough for me!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been investing my time and attention in Precision Nutrition. It&rsquo;s a yearlong coaching programme with workouts and nutrition habits. It&rsquo;s focused on simple, sensible nutrition not fad diets. I feels like I&rsquo;m developing solid nutrition habits that&rsquo;ll last a lifetime. I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>We're back in the house now. Last year defintely felt like the year of the extension. We&rsquo;ve not sorted everything out yet. There's still lots of decorating and clearing out to do. But I finally feel settled again.</p>

<p>Mum has an anerysm on 30 December. She&rsquo;s still recovering. Speech is the biggest issue, but she is getting better week by week. I&rsquo;m heading up to Manchester every two to three weeks to see her.</p>
