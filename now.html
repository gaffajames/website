<h1> What I&rsquo;m doing now</h1>

<p>This is a <a href="http://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">now page</a>. If you have your own site, you should make one, too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just started a new job. I&rsquo;m still at the Department for Transport, but I am now responsible for getting everyone at the Department using digital tools and services. I&rsquo;m also setting up something called the DfT Lab. It will be a team of coders building innovative services to use in-house.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m making decent headway learning German using the <a href="https://fluent-forever.com/" target="_blank">Fluent Forever</a> method, but never have as much time as I would like to focus on it. I have started relearning the guitar, and I have found a somewhat eccentric guy in Holborn to teach me.</p>

<p>My fitness regime is a 5x5 heavy lifting regime at the moment, with a bit of crossfit thrown in to sort out my cardio, which is I always neglect.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not doing all that I&rsquo;m relaxing at home with my wife and two cats.</p>
