<h1> What I&rsquo;m doing now</h1>
</div>
<p>This is a <a href="http://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">now page</a>. If you have your own site, you should make one, too.</p>

<p>I'm up in the Highlands this week. My dad is working his way through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_mountains_and_hills_in_the_British_Isles#Corbetts" target="_blank">Corbetts</a>, and I'm giving him a hand.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still relatively new into a new job. It&rsquo;s the Head of Digital Adoption and Innovation at the Department for Transport. I am responsible for getting everyone at the Department using digital tools and services. I&rsquo;m also setting up something called the <a href ="http://www.gavinjames.co.uk/createyourjob">DfT Lab</a>. The first experiment we are looking at is whether we can use chatbots to give HR advice to staff.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m making decent headway learning German using the <a href="https://fluent-forever.com/" target="_blank">Fluent Forever</a> method, but never have as much time as I would like to focus on it. I have started relearning the guitar, and I have found a somewhat eccentric guy in Holborn to teach me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just changed my fitness regime to a fat cutting workout. It is crossfit-style and, as I am out of condition, it is horrible!</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not doing all that I&rsquo;m relaxing at home with my wife and two cats.</p>
