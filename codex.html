<header><h1> My Codex Vitae </h1></header>
</head>
<body>
	

	<p>I created this Codex Vitae, or <i>book of life,</i> as an exercise within the VIP programme on the <a href="http://www.coach.me/" target="_blank">Coach.me website</a>.</p>

	<p>It is a collection of beliefs and concepts that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The purpose of this document is to pull my beliefs into the light where I can question them more effectively and to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that have been helpful to me.</p>

	<p>Read this with the understanding that you are different than me. The way I live my life is not the way you should live yours. Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.</p>

	<p>A note on how the Codex is structured. You will see pre-decisions under many of the categories. You have probably heard the story about how Steve Jobs wore the same clothes every day. That was a pre-decision; it reduced the burden on his attention, freeing him to focus on more important decisions. I have some, which I have described below.</p>

	<p>I have also included some of my aspirations. These are habits that aren&rsquo;t habits yet. Trying to form too many habits at once dooms you to failure, so I log them as aspirations and tackle them two at a time: one habit to start, and one to stop.</p>

	<h2 id="philosophy">Chapter One: Philosophy</h2>

	<p>Beliefs, principles and political values that guide everything else in the codex.</p>

	<h4 id="meta-beliefs">Meta-beliefs (beliefs about beliefs)</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Beliefs are changeable. If they never change, I never grow.</li>
		<li>Most of my internally generated views are old. Most of my externally generated beliefs come from reading books. This is why I read a lot.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Principles</h4>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&ldquo;Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better.&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<footer>&mdash; Jim Rohn</footer>
	</blockquote>

	<ul>
		<li>Always keep learning.</li>
		<li>Learning is fun, but satisfaction comes with mastery.</li>
		<li>Keep promises, no matter how trivial.</li>
		<li>Some discomfort is a good thing. <a href="https://twitter.com/jockowillink/status/791607287823478784?lang=en" target="_blank">It&rsquo;s the grind that sharpens the axe.</a></li>
		<li>Know your strengths. Build on them.</li>
		<li>Know your weaknesses. Find other people for whom they are strengths.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="politics">Politics and Society</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>You are free to judge other people&rsquo;s beliefs if they impact other people i.e. second-hand smoke, poisoning the environment, etc. Otherwise, leave them alone.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="fears">Fears</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Regrets. Specifically, growing old and feeling I wasted my potential or missed out on experiences that matter to me e.g. living in another culture.</li>
		<li>My body will fail me. Even worse, my mind will fail me.</li>
		<li> <a href="http://www.waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html" target="_blank">Humanity will be destroyed in my lifetime by AI.</li> </a>
	</ul>

	<h4>What am I currently doing to overcome these fears?</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Learning to code.</li>
		<li>Looking for a reasonably priced UK based company for a detailed blood screen.</li>
		<li>Focusing on health and performance in my fitness regime over aesthetic.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="systems">Chapter Two: Personal Systems</h2>

	<p>Systems and tactics for getting the most out of your life.</p>

	<h3 id="productivity">Productivity</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Obsessing over more efficient approaches to to-do lists achieves nothing.</li>
		<li>Letting other people&rsquo;s priorities drive yours will stifle your effectiveness. Focus on that which will improve people&rsquo;s lives the most.</li>
		<li>Never have a meeting if a phone call would do.</li>
		<li>Focus on performance over how you look. One follows the other. This applies to both fitness and work.</li>
		<li>Almost anywhere is a more productive environment than an open plan office. Take the laptop and escape the office for focus.</li>
		<li a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">The Pomodoro technique is a great tool for focus and motivation.</li>
		<li>Habits matter. People overestimate what they can achieve in a day and underestimate what they can achieve in a year.</li>
		<li>Early is on time; on time is late; late is unforgivable.</li>
		<li>Avoid the 24 news cycle. Read thoughtful journals instead.</li>
		<li a href="https://sivers.org/hellyeah" target="_blank">No &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Either &ldquo;Hell yeah!&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</li /a>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="food">Food</h3>

	<ul>
		<li> <a href ="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003TSDNBS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1" target="_blank"> Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much.</a></li>
		<li>Link diet to fitness goals. Lean meals when cutting fat, a calorie surplus when gaining muscle.</li>
		<li>Don't obsess too much about food, but making sure you're eating healthy most of the time.</li>
		<li>Invest in your health. Spend a significant amount of your money on food. Quality matters.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Pre-decisions</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Saturated fat is OK. Choose butter over margarine. Full-fat milk over skimmed.</li>
		<li>Carbs make you tired, so have plenty at dinner rather than lunch.</li>
		<li>When in doubt, make scrambled eggs for breakfast. Add bread only if in a weight gain phase.</li>
		<li>Take creatine, vitamin D and fish oil daily.</li>
		<li>I have had my genome tested. I metabolise caffeine slowly. This is bad for my health, so I have cut caffeine out of my diet.</li>
		<li>Choose what you eat for yourself, not to please other people.</li>
		<li>Avoid buyer&rsquo;s remorse by selecting the first thing you like the look of on a menu.</li>
		<li>Have at least one day off from alcohol a week.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Aspirations</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Reduce sugar intake.</li>
		<li>Cook several times a week.</li>
		<li>Eat wild food once a week.</li>
		<li>Eat more seasonable food.</li>
		<li>Get tested for vitamin D deficiency.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="clothing">Clothing and Style</h3>

	<h4>Beliefs</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Being stylish is more important than being fashionable. Good style never goes out of fashion.</li>
		<li>You can be casual and stylish. Conversely, it is possible to meet the requirements of a smart dress code and look awful.</li>
		<li>Quality over quantity. Only buy and keep clothes that bring you joy.</li>
		<li>If wearing a particular item of clothing makes you feel uncomfortable, get rid of it.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Pre-decisions</h4>

	<p>Three outfits suit me (and most men):
		<ul>
			<li>A well-made suit with white or blue shirt, snazzy tie, black or brown brogues (depending on if the suit is grey/black or blue/tan) and possibly a pocket square.</li>
			<li>Jeans or chinos, smart pumps or brogues, and a casual shirt. Blazer optional.</li>
			<li>Jeans, plain t-shirt, pumps.</li>
			<li>Socks should complement the trousers, not the shoes.</li>
			<li>Never wear clothing with text on it (beyond a small logo).</li>
			<li>Shirts must be ironed. As I dislike ironing, it is worth paying other people to do it.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4>Aspirations</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Only own items of clothing that go together with other items I already own.</li>
		<li>Keep my shoes in better condition (or find someone I can pay to do this).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="people">People</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Listen.</li>
		<li>Be generous with your knowledge, but don't try to change people who don't want to change.</li>
	</ul>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&ldquo;You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him find it within himself.&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<footer>&mdash; Galileo</footer>
	</blockquote>

	<h4>Aspirations</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Give timely, compassionate feedback. Be wary of bad feelings festering. If you think you should say something, you should.</li>
		<li>Don't look for validation from everyone all the time. Even with people you respect, they won't be right about you all the time. </li>
		<li>Introverts have a lot to offer. Find ways to elicit their input.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 id="strangers">Strangers</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Remember people&rsquo;s names.</li>
		<li>People are inherently good. Bad actions come from bad situations.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 id="friends">Friends</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>You are the average of the people you spend the most time with.</li>
		<li>Invest time in your friendships. It will pay dividends when you need them most.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 id="wife">Significant Other</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>A &pound;5000 diamond ring = &pound;5 bouquet of flowers. It is the thought that counts. Gift little and often.</li>
		<li>If one or both of you are angry with each other, check you are not hungry.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 id="family">Family</h4>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&ldquo;Get to know your parents; you never know when they'll be gone for good</p>
		<p>Be nice to your siblings, they are your best link to your past</p>
		<p>And the people most likely to stick with you in the future&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<footer>&mdash; Everybody&rsquo;s Free (to Wear Sunscreen)</footer>
	</blockquote>

	<h4>Aspirations</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>I live away from my family, so I try to call mum weekly and want to make the effort to go back home several times a year.</li>
		<li>Encourage a large, dedicated family gathering with a consistent date on the calendar. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll never see your extended family.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="mental_health">Mental Health</h3>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&ldquo;there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<footer>&mdash; Hamlet (2.2.248-249)</footer>
	</blockquote>

	<h4>Beliefs</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Be the master of your emotions. Your mental health can be independent of what happens to you or around you.</li>
		<li>Most people think I am an extrovert. I&rsquo;m not. I need to be alone to recharge, but too much of this can lead to cabin fever.</li>
		<li>The mind and the body are intertwined. See <a href="#fitness">Physical Fitness</a> and <a href="#food">Food</a>.</li>
		<li>Be grateful. There is always someone in a worse position than you.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Pre-decisions</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Journal daily. Review your journal regularly.</li>
		<li>Let go of the bad stuff. Write about and revisit the good stuff.</li>
		<li>If you are feeling sad, <b>smile</b>. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, laugh.</li>
		<li>Pay attention to your physical state. It is often a mirror to your mental state. And vice versa.</li>
		<li>Keep a folder of <i>feel good emails</i>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Aspirations</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Meditate daily.</li>
		<li>Note what I am appreciative for in my daily journal.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="fitness">Physical Fitness</h3>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&ldquo;No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training.</p>
		<p>It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing</p>
		<p>the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.&rdquo;</p>
		<br>
		<footer>&mdash; Socrates</footer>
	</blockquote>


	<ul>
		<li>Focus on performance over aesthetic.</li>
		<li> Invest in your health. Most personal trainers are awful. Find a good coach who can teach you proper form. If you are in London, I can recommend <a href="http://kinecthealth.co.uk/" target="_blank">Neil Meekings</a>. </li>
		<li>Overtraining leads to injury. Avoid injuries and ease back if one appears.</li>
		<li>Sleep is important. Make time for it. Focus on quality as well as quantity.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="material_world">Material World</h3>

	<ul>
		<li> The things you own end up owning you. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00I0C46BO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1" target="_blank"> Keep only what brings you joy.</a> Remove the junk, so you have room for your treasure.</li>
		<li>If you are comfortable financially, it can be easy to forget you are and want more. If the only debt you have is a mortgage and you can afford to pay it, life is pretty good.</li>
		<li>Quality matters. Buy the best you can afford. Even if this means you cannot buy much.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="work">Chapter Three: Work</h2>

	<p>Lessons for business, work, and building things.</p>

	<h3>Principles</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Simplify. It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer.</li>
		<li>Know what you need to be good at to do your job well. Then become world-class in those skills.</li>
	</ul>

	<blockquote>
		<p> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1473324246&sr=1-1" target="_blank">&ldquo;Be so good they can&rsquo;t ignore you.&rdquo;</a></p>
		<br>
		<footer>&mdash; Steve Martin</footer>
	</blockquote>

	<h3 id="business">Business</h3>

	<ul>
		<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KLnXjqKL5g" target="_blank">Start small. No funding needed.</a> </li>
		<li> <a href ="https://sivers.org/multiply" target="_blank">Ideas are worth nothing without execution.</a> </li>
		<li>  Never forget that you can make your role <a href = "https://sivers.org/a" target="_blank"> anything you want</a> it to be. Anything you hate to do, someone else loves. </li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="leadership">Leadership and management</h3>

	<ul>
		<li> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0044XUINS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1" target="_blank">Be nice.</a> A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall. </li>
		<li>Criticising others creates a toxic environment. Don&rsquo;t do it and discourage other from doing it.</li>
		<li>Trust people to do the right thing. Trust but verify.</li>
		<li>Delegate heavily and hold people accountable. Support people when they need it.</li>
		<li>When it comes to standards, it is not what you preach, but what you tolerate.</li>
		<li>If your boss isn&rsquo;t making a decision promptly or providing necessary support for you or your team, don&rsquo;t blame your boss. First blame yourself. Communicate better.</li>
		<li>The only meaningful measure of a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Write well. It is worth investing time to ensure your ideas are understood easily.</li>
		<li>Look for clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly.</li>
		<li>Don&rsquo;t write in the negative.</li>
		<li>Break the rules every once in a while.</li>
		<li>Cut out modifying words. For example, instead of <i>very interesting</i>, try <i>fascinating</i>.</li>
		<li>Be yourself in your writing.</li>
		<li>Write in the first person. If you are not allowed to, write you first draft in the first person.</li>
		<li>Use <a href="http://gram.ly/q4VZ" target="_blank"> Grammarly</a> to check important documents.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="speaking">Public Speaking</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Use stories over slides.</li>
		<li>Start as you mean to go on; practice without notes.</li>
		<li>Only commit to speaking if you have sufficient time to prepare well. No talk is better than a bad talk, or even worse, a forgettable presentation.</li>
	</ul>
