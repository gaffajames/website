  <h1>The truth about how to get your dream job</h1>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve created my last three jobs. I work at the Department for Transport in the UK (I&rsquo;ll call it the Department from here on). Like any large government organisation, it can be bureaucratic. Creating your own job is not the norm. Here’s what I did and why it worked.</p>

  <h3>Job #1: Programme Manager, Telecoms Services</h3>

    <p>It&rsquo;s 2013. I&rsquo;ve been doing the same job for a few years, and I&rsquo;m ready for a change. Normally this would mean heading to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/index.cgi">Civil Service Jobs site</a> and trawling through jobs designed by someone else. Instead, I found the Department&rsquo;s organisation chart. I&rsquo;d worked in most areas, but there was one I knew nothing about: rail. I figured it would be fun to learn something completely new. I only knew one person in the rail section of the org chart. He was a director who I had always respected. I sent him an email:</p>

    <p>___</p>

    <p>Hi,</p>

    <p>I’m starting to look for a new job. You&rsquo;ve got a great reputation, and I&rsquo;ve always thought it would be great to work for you <em>[a little flattery goes a long way!]</em>. Do you have any jobs available?</p>

    <p>Gavin</p>

    <p>___</p>

    <p>We went for a coffee. He said he had might have something for me in a few months, as one of his staff was looking for another job. I said thanks and thought I&rsquo;d need to start looking again.</p>

    <p>The following week, there was a Cabinet reshuffle (where government ministers are moved or changed). The Department got one more minister than usual. This person who might have been moving in a few months, ended up moving the same day to run this minister&rsquo;s private office. I got back in touch and the job was mine.</p>

    <p>In the first few months, I didn&rsquo;t have a defined role. I was used as a problem solver. It meant I learnt fast and got to work on really interesting problems. After a while, my director told me it was time to settle in a defined role. I got to pick who I wanted to work with and what I wanted to work on. Together my new boss and I created a whole new team out of nothing, and I set to work on my new job: rolling out free Wi-Fi and fixing the phone signal across the British rail network.</p>

  <h3>Job #2: Head of Telecoms, Tech and Data</h3>

    <p>In the first year, I started to see new opportunities. 

    <p>People kept telling me that we couldn&rsquo;t make lots of data in the rail industry openly available. Why? It bugged me. So I made a pitch to my boss. Let&rsquo;s hire someone to look into this.</p>

    <p>I started attending hackathons with dozens of talented people creating elegant solutions to problems on the railway. Shouldn&rsquo;t we be doing more to support this? Again, I went to my boss. Can we make this core part of my role?</p>

    <p>At the same time, I was being asked to take on a massive new project looking at how to make the most of the telecoms network on the railway to raise revenue and fix rural broadband. Sounds great, but that&rsquo;s a lot of work. If we were going to do this, I needed some support.</p>

    <p>And if I took on all of this, that&rsquo;s a much tougher job. So I worked up the courage to ask for a promotion to lead this expanded team.</p>

    <p>It worked. I was put on temporary promotion to this new role I had designed. In the Civil Service, you need to earn a promotion in an open and fair competition. So, several months later I had an interview up against other candidates. I could speak with knowledge and passion because I knew the job inside out. Once again I got a job I&rsquo;d created myself.</p>

  <h3>Job #3: The DfT Lab</h3>

    <p>Throughout this time I had seen how the startup world could achieve great things in the rail industry. I&rsquo;d taken part in some informal hackathons run by staff in the Department. This way of working was fun, creative and effective. Why didn&rsquo;t we do more of it? I started to formulate an idea of a team of software developers and entrepreneurs in something I called the DfT Lab. We would be like a startup inside the Department, with freedom to innovate.</p>

    <p>I knew this was a step up from jobs I&rsquo;d designed in the past. I needed a whole team from day one, and I needed to create it from nothing. One day I clocked off a bit early, headed to the pub, and started writing a business case. I came up with as many benefits as I could think of and ended with a four-page document setting out my vision. I then sent it to everyone I knew who might have any power or influence to make it happen.</p>

    <p>Before too long I discovered that the Department was setting up a new Digital Service, and I should speak the person leading it. I pitched my idea to him. He was interested, but I got the impression that I was too late, and there wasn&rsquo;t a place for my idea either inside or out of this newly designed team. Then, three weeks later, out the blue, I got a call; &ldquo;We like the idea. Do you want to come set up the Lab with us?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe it! I’m now setting up the DfT Lab, and this guy is my new boss.</p>

  <h3>Lessons</h3>

    <p>So what have I learnt, creating all these jobs?</p>

  <h4>Reputation</h5>

    <p>The most important factor in whether people say yes, is whether they can trust you.</p>

    <p>One person who gave me a job told me that he carried in his head a list of people he thought were great. Whenever he had a new job he&rsquo;d start approaching people on that list. Though I&rsquo;d never worked with him directly, I&rsquo;d made it onto the list a few years earlier off the basis of a few interactions here and there.</p>

    <p>When I pitched the DfT Lab, it turned out my old mentor was the boss of the person I was pitching to. Without me knowing anything about it, my mentor vouched for me, and the trust that created was–I think–the deciding factor.</p>

    <p>Assume anyone might be in a position to help you one day. Always go out of your way to help others, especially if they don&rsquo;t know you well.</p>

  <h4>Gumption</h5>

    <p>What&rsquo;s the reason most people have never created their own job? They never asked. In every case, I didn&rsquo;t think what I was doing would work. But I tried anyway.</p>

    <p>If you are worried about asking, write out a list of what you think are the worst things that could happen. Chances are there&rsquo;s not much. Even if it doesn&rsquo;t work out, people will respect you for having ideas and ambition.</p>

    <p>I find embarrassment is often what I&rsquo;m most worried about. What if they think I&rsquo;m an idiot or that it&rsquo;s not my place to ask for such things. If you are struggling with this, I suggest buying <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2uCny2j">The Four Hour Work Week</a> and trying the confidence building exercises at the end of each chapter. The first of these exercises is to hold people&rsquo;s gazes until they look away for a day. It desensitises you to uncomfortable situations.</p>

  <h4>Persistence</h5>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve always been lucky here. When I&rsquo;ve proposed a new job, the first answer has always been no (or my emails are ignored). I&rsquo;ve often given up there, but something changes and makes me ask again.</p>

    <p>When I pitched the DfT Lab, I sent my business case to the Permanent Secretary (the equivalent of a CEO in the Civil Service). I didn&rsquo;t hear from him for weeks. One evening I saw him going into the changing rooms as he&rsquo;s a cyclist. I followed and pretended I was getting something out of my locker (creepy I know…). I spent an unrealistic amount of time fiddling around with the toiletries in the bottom of my locker, until he said &ldquo;oh, hi Gavin! I&rsquo;ve got your proposal, haven&rsquo;t I? I must take a look at that&rdquo;. That led to him lending vital support to the idea. Quiet–albeit a little creepy–persistence paid off.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h5>

    <p>I recently hired someone who&rsquo;d said in the interview that it was his dream job. That&rsquo;s always great to hear as an interviewer. But don&rsquo;t wait for your dream job to come around. Get out there and create it.</p>
