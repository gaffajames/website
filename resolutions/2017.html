<title> Gavin James&rsquo;s 2017 resolutions </title>

<header><h1> Resolutions for 2017 </h1></header>

<body>

	<p>Normally I abhor resolutions. Mine are usually poorly thought through: unmeasurable, unachievable or unimportant. So what&rsquo;s changed? I&rsquo;m writing this two days before 2016 times out. I have just reviewed my year thoroughly, including reading every journal entry I written and my [TK]Codex Vitae. I&rsquo;ve built up a list of things I want to work on based on what I&rsquo;ve already worked out I care about (from my Codex Vitae) and what happens in practice (my journal). This makes for better resolutions&mdash;I hope!</p>

	<p>Two of my resolutions are to write more and to update this website regularly. So what easier way to start than by publishing my plans for 2017. As with my Codex Vitae, feel free to nick any or all of my resolutions. Just make sure they are meaningful and achievable for you.</p>

	<p>I know there are too many things to focus on here, so I am going to experiment and see what is working at the end of January 2017.</p>

	<h2>See things through</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Maintain my focus on health and performance in my fitness regime. It&rsquo;s more important to be strong and flexible than big.</li>
		<li>When I need to prioritise focus solely on the 3Gs&mdash;German, gymnastics and guitar&mdash;in that order.</li>
		<li>Nail the cold element of the Wim Hom Method. Go for a swim in a lake or open air swimming pool in February 2017.</li>
		<li>Maintain my website. Update my now page at least monthly.</li>
		<li>Go on date night every week.</li>
		<li>Focus. Accept that learning to code and several other hobbies aren&rsquo;t a priority.</li>
		<li>Journal daily at 4.45pm without fail. Cover some set items:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>What made me grateful?</li>
				<li>When it comes to standards, it is not what you preach, but what you tolerate. What have I tolerated?</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>Make it easier for me to be healthy</h2>

	<ul>

		<li>Find someone who will cook good, healthy meals cheaply in Orpington.</li>
		<li>Stick to salmon/eggs for breakfast, chicken salad for lunch.</li>
		<li>I don&rsquo;t want to cut out caffeine completely. Find a heuristic so I don&rsquo;t need to think constantly about whether or not to drink caffeine.</li>
		<li>No alcohol two days a week.</li>
		<li>Test my heart rate variance during a normal working week to find out what helps me recharge.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Be a better role model at work</h2>

	<ul>

		<li>Practice, then preach, deep work.</li>
		<li>Give timely, compassionate feedback. Start with at least once a month (I find it very difficult!).</li>
		<li>Turn up early to meetings. No excuses.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Be more effective at work</h2>

	<ul>

		<li>Get more structure in my working day to allow for deep work. Say “no” more (including to myself). Guard my blocked out time strictly.</li>
		<li>Ask myself at least once every day, can I do this differently? More simply, quickly, or not at all?</li>
		<li>Create a kick-ass presentation designed to help me win people to my cause and use it regularly at work.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Make time for more important things</h2>

	<ul>

		<li>Cut down Facebook time to 30 minutes a week.</li>
		<li>Get the house sustainably tidy. Complete the KonMari method.</li>
		<li>Outsource more. Start with polishing shoes.</li>
		<li>Watch less TV, and use the time to read and speak to Anika.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Read more</h2>

	<ul>
		
		<li>Read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&rsquo;t Stop Talking</li>
		<li>Reread So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You.</li>
		<li>Reread How to win friends and influence people.</li>
		<li>Take notes when I listen to podcasts and read books.</li>
		<li>Ignore short blogs. With the exception of Derek Sivers, they are a waste of time. Print out long quality articles and read them.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Write more</h2>

	<ul>
		
		<li>Apply Millard Fuller&rsquo;s advice: “It&rsquo;s easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than to think your way into a new way of acting.” Apply this first to overcome my resistance to starting to write articles, then find something else.</li>
		<li>Write one article a month for my site.</li>
		<li>Focus on improving my writing through applying lessons from books and seeking feedback.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Deepen my relationships with friends &amp; family</h2>

	<ul>
		
		<li>Call my closest friends on their birthday.</li>
		<li>Call or see my closest friends, my mum and dad at least once a month.</li>
		<li>Speak to mum and dad to write up the family tree and stories.</li>
		<li>Go back to Manchester at least three times in 2017.</li>
		<li>Organise a large, dedicated family gathering with a consistent date on the calendar.</li>
	
	</ul>

	<h2>And one for fun...</h2>

	<ul>
		
		<li>Watch all the Oscar Best Pictures back to 1970 by the end of 2017.</li>

	</ul>
